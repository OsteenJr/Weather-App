# Weather-App
This project is a sleek, responsive weather application that fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to input any city name and get current weather information including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and condition-specific icons.
